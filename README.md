ML problems
* 1. Regression techniques: For prediction of contineous value for an unknown case
  * 1.1 Data is numbers + String
* 2. Classification techniques: For prediction of class value for an unknown case
  * 2.1 Data could be:
    * 2.1.1 Numbers+String
    * 2.1.2 Text: Additional Natural language processing techniques
    * 2.1.3 Images: Additional Image processing techniques
    * 2.1.4 Voice: Additional Natural language processing techniques
* 3. Forecasting techniques: For preditions of future batches of time
  * 3.1 Data is usually index = time, X = features & y = value
